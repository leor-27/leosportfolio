      I currently live in Naga City, Cam Sur, Philippines. 
      Above is not exactly my house (it's actually the one in the back) but it is the
      house I grew up in. It’s my grandma’s house. Even though I don’t live
      there anymore, and I don’t even spend a lot of time in my own home because
      of college, I will always cherish that house as it’s where I nourished and
      was nurtured. I had a lot of memories there which I will cherish forever.
